# Hi
My name is Hampus, but online I refer myself to Seffra. My last name is Avekvist, which is why it's related to both names. 
I have been programming as a hobby since 2012 and initially I started building games, but today I work on systems mostly related to networking. 

I am also currently studying for a computer engineering bachelor degree in Sweden. 

My current favourite editor is Neovim, but I have used VS Code professionally so I occasionally relapse. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 
  - hobby: websocket-based card game, server in Go and frontend in TS
  - as a software developer at a telecom firm and
  - as a teacher in high school
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
  - golang and
  - websockets
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on
  - something hardware or data science
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about old telephones
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Coming sometime
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: old phones send signals, and you can interpret those signals however you prefer

I use Arch, by the way.
